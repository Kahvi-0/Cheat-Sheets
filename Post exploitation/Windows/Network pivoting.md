# Pivoting


**Meterpreter methods** 
       
Note that the routes created via meterpreter only aspply to that instance of metasploit.
 If modules are crashing the shell when trying to scan via metasploit module, try running the scan from the compromised machine itself, then launcing targeted attacks from metasploit. 
   
         run autoroute -s <target network seen via enumeration>/CIDR
         
         run autoroute -p   #to confirm
         
       you can now test by pinging a device on the remote network
