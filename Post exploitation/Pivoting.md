**Egrees firewall testing:**

 If python is useable:

 If python is not useable and powershell is: 
 
     powershell.exe Get-Alias -Definition Invoke-WebRequest | Format-Table -AutoSize
     
     powershell.exe curl http://<ip>:<port>/x
     
     
     
 If pwnd target has a connection to a network that we do not have a connection to, we can set up a route on the machine to forward our traffic 
 
   - Meterpreter 
   
         run autoroute -s <target network seen via enumeration>/CIDR
         
         run autoroute -p   #to confirm
         
       you can now test by pinging a device on the remote network
