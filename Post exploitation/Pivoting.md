 If pwnd target has a connection to a network that we do not have a connection to, we can set up a route on the machine to forward our traffic 
 
   - Meterpreter 
   
         run autoroute -s <target network seen via enumeration>/CIDR
         
         run autoroute -p   #to confirm
         
       you can now test by pinging a device on the remote network

**Meterpreter methods** 
       
       Note that the routes created via meterpreter only aspply to that instance of metasploit.
        If modules are crashing the shell when trying to scan via metasploit module, try running the scan from the compromised machine itself, then launcing targeted attacks from metasploit. 
   
         run autoroute -s <target network seen via enumeration>/CIDR
         
         run autoroute -p   #to confirm

**SSH routing can get past a target devices local firewall**
   
    ssh -L <localport>:localhost:<target port> <target SSH user>@<ip>
       
        this will have the target machine locally make the requests and feed them to us. For a website for example if I were to visit <target ip>:<target port>   I would get the website that was originally blocked to me. Observing the network connections while this is taking place shows that all connection on the target PORT on the server are all 127.0.0.1.
