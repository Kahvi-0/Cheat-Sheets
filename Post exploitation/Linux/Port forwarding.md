**SSH routing can get past a target devices local firewall**
   
    ssh -L <localport>:localhost:<target port> <target SSH user>@<ip>
       
        this will have the target machine locally make the requests and feed them to us. For a website for example if I were to visit <target ip>:<target port>   I would get the website that was originally blocked to me. Observing the network connections while this is taking place shows that all connection on the target PORT on the server are all 127.0.0.1.
